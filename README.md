## Overview
This is a Streamlit web app which predicts whether a E-mail/SMS is spam or not.

## Motivation
What to do when you are at home due to this pandemic situation? I started to learn Machine Learning model to get most out of it. I came to know mathematics behind all supervised and unsupervised models. Finally it is important to work on application (real world application) to actually make a difference.
